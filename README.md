# About
This is a simple repository with a bunch of scripts to setup a debian environment with tooling
I've been using for a time.

The scripts don't require an specific order to be executed an are independent from each other.

The format of the scripts will be `{distro-name}-{script-name}.sh`. Some of them has been tested
on dockerized images and WSL systems.
